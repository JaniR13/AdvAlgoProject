	\section{Accomplishments}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Completed Script Outline
		\item Decided on an example to use (kitchen, making Thanksgiving dinner)
		\item Decided on video format (slideshow with voiceover explanation)
		\item Begun work on slideshow
		\item Researched Particle Swarm Optimization
		\item Researched Bayesian Network Learning
	\end{enumerate}
	\section{Remaining Tasks}
	The remaining tasks are outlined in the following table:
	
	\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ |l | c | r|}
	  \hline
	  Date & Persona & Description \\
	  \hline
	  \hline
	  11/21 & David R. & Introduction Portion \\
	  \hline
	  11/27 & JR & +1 Portion \\
	  \hline
	  11/28 & MVL & Analysis and Conclusion \\
	  \hline
	  11/30 & All & Record Voice-over and Slides \\
	  \hline
	  12/03 & All & Complete Editing \\
	  \hline
	  12/04 & All & Video Presentations \\
	  \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	The introduction, +1, and analysis portion will involve designing graphics for the slides, and that will be the most time consuming part of each section.  Each memeber needs to begin working on their task at least three days before its assigned due date to be able to create effective and well-designed slides.
	
	The script for the introduction portion is already completed and some work has been done on the +1 and Analysis scripts.  Recording the voice over and timing the slide transitions will be a rather easy task and can likely be done in just a few hours.
